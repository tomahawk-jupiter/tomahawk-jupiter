# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter

I'm interested in MERN stack, Python, data analyses, blockchain, bash. MERN stack is probably my strongest skill so far.

I'm very dedicated to improving my skills and knowledge, I study and practise every day. My aim is to get a job in this industry and in the mean time learn as much as I can.

## My Journey So Far

I started learning how to code at the end of Jan 2021 and was immediately obsessed! I have come so far when I look back to where I began! Its been challenging and frustrating at times as I'm sure everyone who learns this stuff will understand!

Jan '21
I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) aswell as some supplemental youTube tutorials. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) channel is a great resource.

Setting up and using my own local development environment with VSCode, Node, NPM, and Git was very rewarding and so was learning how to deploy my first full stack app! I spent alot of time playing around with MERN stack and plain CSS.

Next I found the free CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX and Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms by google on Udacity which were very helpful for learning some computer science fundamentals giving me a better understanding of whats happening behind the scenes. 

June & Jul '22
I followed along to the [Patrick Collins blockchain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) to learn something about all that cool stuff.

Sep '22
I learnt about bash and bash scripting from various resources (I really like using bash, makes me feel like a hacker in a movie!) and started using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to practise coding skills and various languages.

Oct '22
Recently I installed LAMP stack and wordpress to play around with that stuff a bit and maybe learn a bit of PHP. Also I installed jupiter notebook in a virtualenv with the aim to practise some data analyses using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib because I find that stuff really interesting. 

I need to find another place to host my fullstack projects now that Heroku are stopping the free tier! 

## Project Ideas

I've been thinking about making a guitar teaching website app or blog or something for a real world project. I've been looking at and playing with tab, music and chord diagram libraries so that I can use them to notate lessons and examples. I would also like to include audio or video recordings for each example.
