# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter.

I'm a self taught (with the help of some excellent free resources!) coder.

Besides coding I'm also into playing guitar, mostly fingerstyle and blues. I've spent some time trying to figure out the best way to include guitar tab (for fingerstyle arrangements) on a webpage but haven't found anything satisfactory yet.

## My Journey So Far

This is a log of my coding journey.

Jan '21  
I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and google/youtube when I got stuck. This is where I was first introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the MERN stack. I also learnt a bit about python and its packages like pandas.

I installed ubuntu at some point, everything got easier after that!

Next I found the free CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX which I found very helpful in improving my understanding of computer fundamentals.

Jul '22  
I followed along to the [Patrick Collins blockchain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) to learn something about web3.

Sep '22  
I learnt some bash and bash scripting from various resources. I also started using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to practise coding skills and various languages.

Oct '22  
I installed LAMP stack and wordpress to play around with.

I installed jupyter notebook to play around with pandas, matplot, etc. and also look at some machine learning stuff. I found [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and have been going through some of their tutorials.

I got a new computer. I installed Anaconda which made getting setup with python and jupyter etc very easy, previously I was using virtualenv.

Feb '23  
I've been playing around with Material UI and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Also emotion and styled-components.

I installed xampp and learnt how to make a basic PHP & mySql website.

May '23  
I learnt some Java and how to make a basic android app. I really liked java.

Followed getting started tutorials for Vuejs, Django and Nextjs to see what they're like.

I've decided to start a blog so I can log what I learn. I'm going to use Nextjs to build it. I've been trying different ways to get syntax highlighting working for code examples.
