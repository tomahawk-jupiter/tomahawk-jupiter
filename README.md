# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter

I'm interested in alot of things but have mostly been learning / using the MERN stack so far. Recently I've been learning about web3 / blockchain which I find very exciting.

I'm very dedicated to improving my skills and knowledge, I study and practise every day. My primary goal is to build a career in this industry.

## My Journey So Far

I started learning how to code at the end of Jan 2021 and was immediately obsessed! I have come so far when I look back to where I began! Its been challenging and frustrating at times as I'm sure everyone who learns this stuff will understand!

I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) aswell as some supplemental youTube tutorials. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) channel is a great resource.

Setting up and using my own local development environment with VSCode, Node, NPM, and Git was very rewarding and so was learning how to deploy my first full stack app!

Recently I found the free CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX and Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms by google on Udacity which were very helpful for learning some computer science fundamentals giving me a better understanding of whats happening behind the scenes. 

Currently I'm learning about the blockchain from the [Patrick Collins freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) video and from the cool [cryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) game/tutorial.

Apart from this I'm practising and learning other bits and pieces. I hope to get more involved in the community, so far I've just been learning and making things by myself.
