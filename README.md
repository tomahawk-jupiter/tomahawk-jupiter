# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter.

I've been learning to code for a while now. I started with FreeCodeCamp and then The Odin project (both focus mosly on MERN stack). Since completing those I've been learning from various resources.

I've mostly been practising web development but I'm interested in and have learnt lots of other coding/computer related things.

My goal is to escape my horrible retail job and do something more intellectually and financially rewarding!

I'm pretty confident/competant with React now and more recently been mostly using NextJS to make things. I can make MERN stack apps but haven't had any professional experience yet so don't know for sure what my ability level really is.

## Some other things I've studied/played around with

- Python: some data analyses and a little machine learning
- SQL
- Some Bash & Bash scripting
- A little bit of Java
- Computer Science basics
