# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter

I'm relatively new to coding but I've got really into it! Mostly I use the MERN stack but I'm always learning new things. Besides coding I'm also into playing guitar, mostly fingerstyle and blues.

I'm trying to gain enough skills and experience to start a career in web development or some other kind of coding. I'm open to meeting new people and collaborating on projects.

You can contact me via my portfolio, its a bit basic at the moment but I'm going to sort it out soon.

## My Journey So Far

This is a log of my coding journey if anyones interested. It also serves as a reference for myself.

I started learning how to code at the end of Jan 2021 and was immediately obsessed! I have come so far when I look back to where I began!

Jan '21  
I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and various youTube videos. This is where I was first introduced to the MERN stack.

Setting up and using my own local development environment with VSCode, Node, NPM, and Git was very rewarding and so was learning how to deploy my first full stack app! I spent alot of time playing around with MERN stack and plain CSS.

Next I found the free CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX and Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms by google on Udacity which were very helpful for learning some computer science fundamentals giving me a better understanding of whats happening behind the scenes.

June & Jul '22  
I followed along to the [Patrick Collins blockchain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) to learn something about all that cool stuff.

Sep '22  
I learnt some bash and bash scripting from various resources and started using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to practise coding skills and various languages.

Oct '22  
Recently I installed LAMP stack and wordpress to play around with that stuff a bit and maybe learn some PHP. Also I installed jupiter notebook to play around with pandas and matplot etc. and also look at some machine learning stuff. I found [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and have been going through some of their tutorials.

Feb '23  
I've been playing around with Material UI and also [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I'm trying to learn how to streamline the web dev process with different tools and services, and get up to a professional standard. I learnt some mySql and PHP using xampp.

## Whats Next?

I'm looking to get some real world experience and meet some other coders who I can learn from or collaborate with. I might look at Django or Flask, or maybe learn some Java next. 

Currently I'm working on building some better projects for my portfolio.
