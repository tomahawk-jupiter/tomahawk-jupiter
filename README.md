# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, this is a little about my coding journey.

I started with FreeCodeCamp and then The Odin project (both focus mosly on MERN stack). Since completing those I've been learning from various resources.

More recently I came across the OSSU Computer Science curriculum which provides a learning path for self study and have been working my way through that.

My repo mostly consists of practice and learning projects, so far I haven't worked on any professional ones.
