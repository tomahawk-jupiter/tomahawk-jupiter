# Tomahawk Jupiter

Hello, I'm tomahawk-jupiter

I'm interested in alot of things but have mostly been learning / using the MERN stack so far. Recently I've been learning about web3 / blockchain which I find very exciting (but also challenging!).

I'm very dedicated to improving my skills and knowledge, I study and practice every day. My primary goal is to build a career in this industry.

## My Journey So Far

I started learning how to code at the end of Jan 2021 and was immediately obsessed! I have come so far when I look back to where I began! Its been challenging and frustrating at times as I'm sure everyone who learns this stuff will understand!

I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) aswell as some supplemental youTube tutorials. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) channel is a great resource.

Setting up and using my own local development environment with VSCode, Node, NPM, and Git was very rewarding and so was learning how to deploy my first full stack app!

Since these two courses I've been practicing what I've learnt and learning about other packages and frameworks aswell.

Recently I found the free CS50 Intro to Computer Science course on edX and Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms by google on Udacity which were very helpful for learning some computer science fundamentals. 

I have been going through the [freeCodeCamp interview section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/) to practice the algorithm and data structure material there, I've been doing these in my local dev environment and writing tests for them using Jest to get some more practice.

## What Next?

Theres so much I want to learn! But I think what I should really concentrate on now is branching out into the community and contributing to other projects to build the confidence to start applying for coding jobs.

I'm currently going through this [blockchain course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) on YouTube. I find the whole decentralized nature of the blockchain fascinating.

Some other things I want to work on is getting better at writing tests, documentation and refactoring my code. I also want to learn and start using TypeScript.
